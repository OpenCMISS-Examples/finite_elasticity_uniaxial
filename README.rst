Template OpenCMISS example - input arguments
============================================

This example shows how input arguments required for an examplar C++ example can be implemented.  For more detailed information refer to the `master <https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/template_example/tree/master>`_ branch.

Inputs
======

If the example requires arguments to be input to the application to get the expected results then this information should be set in a file named *arguments.cmake* inside a directory named *inputs*.  The documentation should also state which arguments must be passed to the application to get the expected results.

Remember
========

Replace this file with a description about your example.
