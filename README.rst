Template OpenCMISS example - input files
========================================

This example shows how input files required for an examplar fortran example can be implemented.  For more detailed information refer to the `master <https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/template_example/tree/master>`_ branch.

Input files
===========

If the example requires files to be used as resources for the application, for example a CellML file, 
to get the expected results then resource files such as this should be added inside a directory named inputs. The documentation needs to state which resource files are required to result in the expected results.

Remember
========

Replace this file with a description about your example.
