Template OpenCMISS example - input files
========================================

This example shows how input files required for an examplar fortran example can be implemented.  For more detailed information refer to the `master <https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/template_example/tree/master>`_ branch.

Input files
===========

If the example requires files to be used as resources for the application, for example a CellML file, 
to get the expected results then resource files such as this should be added inside a directory named inputs. The documentation needs to state which resource files are required to result in the expected results.

The CMake file *src/fortran/CMakeLists.txt* has a minor change to copy over the resource file into the build directory.  There are other alternative solutions to the problems of resource file and we need to choose the best option for that best matches the example.  Below is the modified *src/fortran/CMakeLists.txt* file::

  add_executable(XXXXXXXX ZZZZZZZZ.F90)

  target_link_libraries(XXXXXXXX PUBLIC opencmisslibs mpi)

  # This application requires an input file to execute correctly we have several options
  # as to how we can make this happen.
  #   1. Copy resource.txt file from src directory to build directory.
  #      - This works well for small files.
  #   2. Modify the example so that we can pass the file location through as a parameter.
  #      - This is a good option for bigger files.
  #   3. Create symlinks to the resource file with CMake.
  #      - This is an awkward option with lots of drawbacks, most notably it won't work on Windows.
  #   4. Configure the source file to contain the absolute location of the resource file.
  #      - Usually this would be done in a header file and works well but requires a bit of CMaking.
  # 
  # For this example situation we will use option 1. as it is the best fit.
  # We will make use the configure file CMake command.  This command will copy over a new file if any
  # changes have been made to the original.  Consult the CMake documentation for explanation on the
  # parameters of this function.
  configure_file(inputs/resource.txt ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/resource.txt)
